# What is this?

This is the demo repo from the roll your own git in go series. The series is
available at
[pheuberger.com](https://www.pheuberger.com/roll-your-own-git-in-go-part-1-arg-parsing/).
It's a basic git client written in go. It will support basic commands such as
`init`, `add`, `status` and `commit`. The goal is **not** to re-implement git in
its entirety.

# Why?

I created this to better understand how git works under the hood and while I'm
at it learn go.
